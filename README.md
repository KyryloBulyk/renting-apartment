# 🏡 House Prices Prediction Project

Welcome to the House Prices Prediction Project! This project aims to predict house prices using a variety of features provided in the dataset. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on various parameters.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques".
- **Goal**: Predict the sale price of houses based on various features.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-prices-prediction.git
   cd house-prices-prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset**:
   - Go to [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
   - Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` and place them in the `house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques` directory.

## 🔍 Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The first step involves exploring and preprocessing the data. The following tasks are performed:

1. **Loading the data**: Using Pandas to load the train and test datasets.
2. **Handling missing values**: Filling or dropping missing values.
3. **Converting categorical data**: Using one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
4. **Correlation analysis**: Identifying features most correlated with the target variable (SalePrice).

## 🧪 Model Building

After preprocessing the data, the next steps involve:

1. **Splitting the data**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Training the model**: Using various machine learning algorithms to train the model.
3. **Evaluating the model**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## 📈 Results and Evaluation

The final model's performance is evaluated and compared using different metrics. Visualizations are used to interpret and understand the results better.

## 📊 Visualizations

Several visualizations are created to explore the data and the results, including:

- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution of SalePrice
- Scatter plots of important features vs. SalePrice

## 📝 Usage

Run the analysis script to see the data exploration, preprocessing, and model building steps in action:

```bash
python house_prices_analysis.py
```
